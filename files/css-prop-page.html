<h1>CSS Properties</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>This is a page that we're using to demonstrate various CSS
properties and techniques. Because of that, it's probably going
to be ugly.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Yup, it's turning out rather ugly, but it's important to
demonstrate some CSS stuff. Here are some of the new things:</p>
<ul>
<li>more CSS properties</li>
<li>the box model</li>
<li>the units of length used</li>
</ul>
