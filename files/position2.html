<h1>Positioning Example</h1>

<section id="p1">
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<figure id="happy"><img src="happy.png" alt="Happy Face" /></figure>
<p>This is a page that we can use to test various ways of positioning content. We'll work with the happy face image.</p>
</section>

<section id="p2">
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>In the second paragraph, there is also no meaningful content. This text doesn't really have much purpose, it's just filler.</p>
