<h1>Another HTML Page</h1>
<p>We have now learned some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">
basics of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></a>: tags
and attributes. There is more to learn, but that's enough to get us
started.</p>

<h2 id="future">More to Learn</h2>
<p>We have more to work on: entities, validation, and how everything
fits together. We'll look at that soon. We will also talk about how CSS
and JavaScript relate to HTML.</p>

<h2 id="not-covered">Not In This Course</h2>
<p>There are some aspects of HTML that we won't cover in this course,
but not many. We won't cover some of the more advanced aspects of
embedding content or interaction.</p>
