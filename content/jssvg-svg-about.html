<p>The SVG image format is strange in some ways. You use it like other image formats (PNG, JPEG, etc.) but it technically has more in common with HTML.</p>

<section id="format">
<h2>The SVG Format</h2>

<p>As we have said, the SVG image format is a vector image format created for use on the web (but not limited to the web: it can be used in any context you need a vector image).</p>

<p>The actual format of an SVG file is actually very similar to HTML: they were both created with similar underlying technologies. SVG images are stored as text files, and contain tags and attributes, much like HTML. Let's look again at the SVG image we created in the previous section using JavaScript and {{raph}}:</p>

{{ figure('raph1-res', 'SVG image created by JavaScript code', extension='svg', referenced=False) }}

<p>Our JavaScript actually created this SVG code (simplified slightly here for readability) on the web page:</p>

{{ quoted_code('figures/raph1-res.svg') }}

<p>You can actually copy-and-paste that code into a text editor, save it as a <code class="file">.svg</code> file and open it as an image.</p>

<p>You can see lots of recognizable things there. There are tags that open and close. The tags have attributes and contain content.</p>

<p>The details aren't important: you won't need to create SVG files like this but hopefully it will help you see why {{raph}} works the way it does. For example, the <code class="js">.attr()</code> method is named that way because it literally adds attributes to elements.</p>

<p>If you're exploring the {{raph}} reference or some other SVG materials, you may see examples given or explained with SVG code like that.</p>

<p>You can also see a little of what {{raph}} is doing to make things easier. For example, when creating the rectangle in that example, our code just specified &ldquo;rotate 30 degrees&rdquo; (with <code class="js">'transform': 'r30'</code>). {{raph}} turned that into a &ldquo;transformation matrix&rdquo; which is nice, because I didn't want to do whatever calcuation created it.</p>

<h2>Editing SVG</h2>

<p><a href="https://inkscape.org/"><dfn id="inkscape">Inkscape</dfn></a> is a free, open-source, vector graphics editor. It is designed as an SVG editor: the format that it works with by default and best is SVG.</p>

<p>We will generally be creating SVG with JavaScript and {{raph}}, but that's really because we're using them as a programming exercise. Most of the time, if you need to create an SVG, Inkscape is a good choice.</p>

<p>As we work with {{raph}} to create SVG, you can look back at Inkscape and see a correspondance between what can be done with the two tools. Both can create ellipses, rectangles, text, and so on. This is no accident: even though the work in a very different way, both are fundamentally tools to create SVG images.</p>

<p>You can also take a <code class="file">.svg</code> file created by Inkscape and open it in a text editor. You will see code like the above that represents your image.</p>
