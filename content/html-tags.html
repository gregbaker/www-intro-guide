<p>In the example <a href="html-markup.html#code-firstsample">fragment of an HTML file</a> in the last topic, we saw our first piece of HTML markup. This is part of what goes in an HTML file, but there needs to be more to make a complete page.</p>

<p>HTML files are edited with a text editor: just make sure you save the file with the extension <code class="file">.html</code> (i.e. name it something like <code class="file">mypage.html</code>).</p>

<p>There are a few basic pieces that need to go in an HTML file to get us started. Here's an empty HTML page: this is code you can type into a text editor and save as <code class="file">something.html</code>.</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/emptypage.html') }}

<p>That certainly deserves some explanation, but you can copy-and-paste it into a text editor now if you'd like to experiment. That is a perfectly complete (but empty) HTML page.</p>

<h2>HTML Tags</h2>

<p>The things wrapped in triangular braces (the <code class="html">&lt;&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;&gt;</code> characters) are called <dfn>tags</dfn>. These are the most important part of HTML markup that is used to describe the structure of content. There are both <dfn>opening tags</dfn> and <dfn>closing tags</dfn> (or <dfn>starting tags</dfn> and <dfn>ending tags</dfn>) which come in pairs to enclose pieces of content.</p>

<p>For example, in the above example, <code class="html">&lt;title&gt;</code> is an opening tag, and <code class="html">&lt;/title&gt;</code> is the corresponding closing tag. The <code class="html">&lt;title&gt;</code> tag is used to enclose the main title for the document: the one that is displayed in the title bar of the browser (and used as the label if you bookmark the page, and displayed in search engine results for the page).</p>

<p>One other tag we should look at right away: the <code class="html">&lt;body&gt;&hellip;&#8203;&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag is used to encose the main part of the page: the actual content that you read in the browser's main window.</p>

<p>Let's add a little to our page so there's actually something to see when we load it:</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/firstpage.html') }}

<p>The <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;&hellip;&#8203;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag is used to enclose a paragraph on the page. The sentence &ldquo;This is a paragraph on my page.&rdquo; will appear formatted as a paragraph when we view the page in a web browser. You can view <a href="{{ rellink }}files/firstpage.html">this HTML file</a> here.</p>

<p>Also try working with it: copy-and-paste that HTML code into your text editor, save it as a <code class="file">.html</code> file, and open that file in your web browser. It should look the save as when you clicked the link in the last paragraph. Try adding a second paragraph after the one in the example; reload the page in the browser to see what it looks like.</p>

<p>The term <dfn>element</dfn> is used to refer to one instance of a tag and its contents. For example in the above, there is one title element, <code class="html">&lt;title&gt;My First Page&lt;/title&gt;</code> which has an opening tag (<code class="html">&lt;title&gt;</code>), a closing tag (<code class="html">&lt;/title&gt;</code>), and contents (<code class="html">My First Page</code>),</p>

<h2>Basic Tags</h2>

<p>There are several tags in the example above that haven't been explained yet. These need to be in every HTML page.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></dt><dd>This isn't really a tag or an element, it is the <dfn>document type declaration</dfn> (or <dfn>doctype</dfn>) for the page. This doctype indicates that the page is HTML5. The doctype doesn't have a closing version: it's the first thing in an <code class="file">.html</code> file and stands alone.</dd>
<dt><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;&hellip;&lt;/html&gt;</code></dt><dd>This element contains entire HTML page. It should be the first tag to start (after the doctype) and last to close.</dd>
<dt><code class="html">&lt;head&gt;&hellip;&lt;/head&gt;</code></dt><dd>This element contains information <em>about</em> the page (as opposed to content of the page). For now, it will hold only the <code class="html">&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code class="html">&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags.</dd>
<dt><code class="html">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;</code></dt><dd>This tag tells the browser about the &ldquo;character encoding&rdquo; for this document. The details aren't important now, but it's a property of how the text file is encoded when it is saved. This <code class="html">&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag should be in every HTML file like this.
<p>You may have also noticed that it has no closing tag, and that there's some extra stuff in the tag. We will get to that very soon&hellip;</p></dd>
<dt><code class="html">&lt;body&gt;&hellip;&lt;/body&gt;</code></dt><dd>Finally, this element contains the actual content of the page: the part that is displayed in the main browser window. Most of the new tags we learn will go somewhere in the <code class="html">&lt;body&gt;</code>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These tags are always arranged this way in every HTML page. In our example, we have a simple <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code> element in the body: that is where we will need to expand the number of tags we know first.</p>
