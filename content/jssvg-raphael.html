<p class="draft">Rapha&euml;l is a library that lets us play with SVG images. That sounds like fun.</p>

<section id="starting">
<h2>Starting with {{raph}}</h2>

<p>In this section, we will start using a JavaScript library that we can use to create and manipulate SVG graphics on the page.</p>

<p>Recall that SVG is a vector graphics format: the image is made up of shapes not pixels. Because of this, we can use JavaScript code to create of manipulate those shapes. If we were working with bitmapped images, we would have to draw pixels: there are libraries to help with that but vector images are just easier to work with to start with.</p>

<p id="raphael">The library we will be working with is called <dfn>{{raph}}</dfn>. It is a library created to make working with SVG images easy in JavaScript. As a first example of working with {{raph}}, let's recreate the &ldquo;simple image&rdquo; from the graphics topic:</p>

{{ figure('vector-bitmap1', 'A simple image', extension='svg', referenced=False) }}

<p>This image is 50 pixels wide and high. The circle is centred in the image (at x=25 and y=25) and has radius 24. (I know these things because I looked at the original SVG image in Inkscape.)</p>

<p>To start with, we need a HTML page that will contain our work:</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/raph1.html') }}

<p>The page is similar to the others we have seen, but it include the {{raph}} library. The <code class="html">&lt;div id="container"&gt;</code> will hold the image we create.</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/raphael1.js') }}

<p>You can <a href="{{rellink}}files/raph1.html">have a look at this page</a> to see that the result is pretty close. Here's a screenshot of what it looks like in one browser:</p>

{{ figure('raph1', 'Screenshot of our first '+raph+' page', extension='png', referenced=False) }}

<p>Let's look more closely at the contents of the <code class="js">setup</code> function that is doing the work:</p>

<dl>
<dt id="paper"><code class="js">paper = Raphael('container', 50, 50);</code></dt>
<dd>This creates a {{raph}} SVG object inside the thing with <code class="html">id="container"</code> that is 50 pixels wide, and 50 pixels high. We store it in a variable <code class="js">paper</code> because {{raph}} calls the thing you draw on a <dfn data-term="paper ({{raph}})">paper</dfn>.</dd>
<dt id="circle"><code class="js">circ = paper.circle(25, 25, 24);</code></dt>
<dd>A paper object contains a function <code class="js dfn" data-term=".circle()">circle</code> that draws a circle on it. This line creates a circle with centre at point (25, 25) and radius 24. We'll put the circle object into the variable <code class="js">circ</code> because we need to change some of its properties in the next line.</dd>
<dt id="attr"><code class="js">circ.attr(&hellip;);</code></dt>
<dd>Every SVG shape object in {{raph}} contains the <code class="js dfn" data-term=".attr()">attr</code> method that can be used to change various attributes of the shape. The argument that you give to <code class="js">attr</code> is an object with the properties you want to shape to have. In this case, we want to manipulate the circle to make it look more like our example.</dd>
<dt><code class="js">{ 'fill': '#f00', &hellip; }</code></dt>
<dd>This JavaScript object describes the appearance of the shape, almost as if they were CSS rules for the shape. The first one  (<code class="js">'fill'</code>) sets the colour <em>inside</em> the shape to red. The others in this example set the outline colour and thickness.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There are many attributes that can be set on SVG elements to control the way they look. We will cover them as you need them: there are SVG reference materials out there, but you won't need them for this course.</p>

<section id="example">
<h2>Another Example</h2>

<p>Let's have a look at a few more things {{raph}} can do. Here we create a 200 &times; 100 pixel image (SVG measures in pixels by default even though it's vector-based: it's just a convenient unit of measure in this context) and add a few elements to it:</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/raphael2.js') }}

<p>Here, we created an ellipse with a particular line and fill type; some text giving the font; and a rectangle that has been rotated 30 degrees (clockwise). The result looks like this:</p>

{{ figure('raph2', 'SVG image created in this example', extension='svg', referenced=False) }}

<p>As you can see, there are many functions in the paper object that are used to create shapes and other elements. The details can be found in the <a href="{{ raphref_url }}">{{raph}} reference</a>, but we will introduce the ones you need here: no need to dive into that reference unless you really want to have a look around.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="{{ raph_ref_url('Paper', 'ellipse') }}"><code class="js">.ellipse()</code> function</a> needs four arguments: the <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> (horizontal and vertical) positions for the centre of the ellipse, and the horizontal and vertical radius. For <a href="{{ raph_ref_url('Paper', 'text') }}"><code class="js">.text()</code></a>, you give the <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> position and the actual text to display. For <a href="{{ raph_ref_url('Paper', 'rect') }}"><code class="js">.rect()</code></a>, the arguments are <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, width and height.</p>

<p>The <a href="{{ raph_ref_url('Element', 'attr') }}"><code class="js">.attr()</code> function</a> that every element in the image has is a little more complicated since it can be used to set many visual characteristics of the elements. The way it can be used varies by the type of element it's applied to.</p>

<p>Note the extra <code class="js">{&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;}</code> in the arguments: the values we are giving are actually elements of a JavaScript object, which we will discuss in detail later. For now, just make sure to specify the values as in the examples.</p>

<p>We will also explore the different attributes you can specify here as we go on.</p>
