<p class="draft">Keeping content and appearance separate: tips and examples</p>

<p>We have two different technologies for content and the way it looks: HTML and CSS. The idea behind these is that the two different roles are kept separate using the two languages.</p>

<p>If you have been following the advice in {{xref("html-semantic")}}, then this shouldn't be too hard. The way you write your HTML should still be about content: choose markup based on what the pieces mean and what are they for.</p>

<section id="basics">
<h2>Basic Ideas</h2>

<p>We have covered the basic ideas of separating content and appearance already when discussing HTML and CSS.</p>

<ul>
<li>When writing HTML, think about your content, not the way you want it to look.</li>
<li>Choose tags so their meaning (which you will find discussed in <a href="{{ htmlref_url }}">a good HTML reference</a>) matches your content.</li>
<li>If the tags aren't specific enough, add a <code class="html">class</code> or <code class="html">id</code> to distinguish particular elements as semantically-different.</li>
<li>Choose <code class="html">class</code> and <code class="html">id</code> values to reflect meaning as well, not to describe an appearance.</li>
<li>If no existing tag matches the content you have, use a generic tag (<code class="html">&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code class="html">&lt;span&gt;</code>) with a meaningful <code class="html">class</code> or <code class="html">id</code>.</li>
<li>Use CSS to specify how you want pieces of content to look.</li>
<li>If you need to, go back and add markup (especially <code class="html">class</code> or <code class="html">id</code> attributes) to your HTML as you're creating your CSS. Don't slip into saying things about appearance in your HTML when doind this.</li>
</ul>

<p>We haven't talked much about the third compontent: behaviour. We will do this when introducing JavaScript, and will add another point:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use JavaScript to modify the behaviour of your content. Don't add behaviour-related things to your HTML or CSS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p class="draft">What this gets us: can re-use content in different contexts: different CSS for mobile, or an ebook, or .... Separate author/designer roles. Re-skin a whoe site with one CSS change</p>
