<p>You have now seen (only) one example of how jQuery can be used to manipulate an HTML page. There are a lot more things we can do, and that will require some more basics of JavaScript and jQuery.</p>

<section id="selectors">
<h2>jQuery Selectors</h2>

<p>In the last example, we saw this code fragment and said that it affected every <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code> on the page.</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/selector1.js') }}

<p id="select">The string <code class="js">'p'</code> given to the <code class="js">jQuery</code> function is a <dfn>selector</dfn> (or <dfn>jQuery selector</dfn> to be more specific). In this case, it selects all paragraphs exactly like the CSS selector <code class="css">p</code> does. (Remember {{ xref('css-selectors') }}?)</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/selector2.css') }}

<p> This is not an accident: jQuery selectors were designed to work like CSS selectors because most developers already know how to use CSS selectors and find them easy to work with.</p>

<p>For example, you can select the element from a page with <code class="html">id="special"</code> like this:</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/selector3.js') }}

<p>That is probably the most useful jQuery selector, since you often want to modify a specific element, and we know that <code class="html">id</code> values must be unique (otherwise the page won't validate). Thus, selecting by <code class="html">id</code> gives us an easy way to grab a particular element.</p>

<p>There are some differences between CSS selectors and jQuery selectors, but for now you can safely assume they are the same. (The differences are mostly that jQuery extends things so you can specify things in jQuery that won't work in CSS.)</p>

</section>

<section id="object">
<h2>jQuery Objects</h2>

<p id="obj">We can now use the <code class="js">jQuery(&hellip;)</code> function to select various parts of the page. After calling the function, what it gives back is a <dfn>jQuery object</dfn>. As mentioned in {{ xref('js-varfunc', fragment='objects') }}, <dfn>objects</dfn> in JavaScript can contain other stuff: numbers, strings, functions, etc.</p>

<p>This is the first object we have actually worked with: <code class="js">jQuery('p')</code> is an object with a bunch of stuff in it.</p>

<p>To get at the stuff inside an object, we use the dot (<code class="js">.</code>), so <code class="js">jQuery('p').click</code> refers to something named <code class="js">click</code> in that object. We know that <code class="js">click</code> is in there because it's in the jQuery documentation, which also says that it's a function we can call.</p>

<p>Here is a closer look at the parts of the jQuery statement above, and why it does what it does:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code class="js">jQuery</code></dt>
<dd>The main jQuery function that we use to access the library's functionality.</dd>
<dt><code class="js">jQuery('p')</code></dt>
<dd>A jQuery object representing all paragraphs on the page.</dd>
<dt><code class="js">jQuery('p').click</code></dt>
<dd>A function that operates on all everything in the jQuery object (in this case, all paragraphs).</dd>
<dt><code class="js">jQuery('p').click(say_hello)</code></dt>
<dd>Calling that function gives us a statement that actually does something: it connects the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function to the click event of everything in that jQuery object.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There are many other things in each jQuery object, and we will work with some as the course goes on.</p>
</section>


<section id="modify">
<h2>Modifying the Page</h2>

<p>After we select some part(s) of the page with the <code class="js">jQuery</code> function, there are lots of things we can do with  the result. So far, we have only seen one thing: connect a function to the &ldquo;click&rdquo; event.</p>

<p id="html">There is another function in jQuery objects called <code class="js dfn" data-term=".html()">html</code> that can be used to modify the contents of the page. Let's look at another complete page example to see it work. Here is <a href="{{rellink}}/files/manipulate.html">an HTML page</a> that we can work with:</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/manipulate.html') }}

<p>And here is a JavaScript file <code class="file">manipulate-page.js</code> that it references with its <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code> element:</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/manipulate-page.js') }}

<p>The last line here does the same thing as before: calls the <code class="js">setup</code> function when the page is finished loading. The <code class="js">setup</code> function connects two events to two functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the element with <code class="html">id="changeme"</code> is clicked, call the <code class="js">p_click</code> function.</li>
<li>When any <code class="html">&lt;h1&gt;</code> (there's only one) have the mouse pointer move over it (a &ldquo;mouseover&rdquo; event), call the <code class="js">h1_hover</code> function.</li>
</ul>

<p>When either of those events occur, the corresponding function (<code class="js">p_click</code> or <code class="js">h1_hover</code>) is called. They select the paragraph with <code class="js">jQuery('#changeme')</code>.</p>

<p>Then the <code class="js">html</code> function is used to change the contents of that paragraph. The string given to <code class="js">html</code> is used to replace the contents for the (first) element selected by the <code class="js">jQuery</code> call. After the functions run, the page will look as if we had these in the original HTML (respectively):</p>

<p>We can combine these ideas any way we want. We can now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select various parts of the page with jQuery selectors.</li>
<li>Attach functions to events on those parts of the page.</li>
<li>Replace the HTML contents of elements on the page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just this gives us many ways to introduce interesting behaviour into our pages. We will see more things JavaScript and jQuery can do later.</p>
