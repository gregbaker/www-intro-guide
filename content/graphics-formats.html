<p class="draft">Graphics formats: bitmap vs vector. When to choose SVG, PNG, GIF, JPEG.</p>

<p>There are several different ways to represent images in a computer (and on web pages). In this section, we will discuss some common choices for the web, and how you would choose between them.</p>

<section id="bitmap-vector">
<h2>Bitmap and Vector Images</h2>

<p>There are two fundamental ways images can be represented in computers, and we should start there.</p>

<p>Let's start with a very simple image to use as an example. It's not a complicated image: a red circle with a black outline, but it will be enough to highlight the difference.</p>

{{ figure('vector-bitmap1', 'A simple image', extension='svg', referenced=False) }}

<p id="vector-img">A <dfn>vector image</dfn> is represented as a collection of shapes: lines, curves, circles, squares, etc. This example image is particularly well suited to representation as a vector image: the computer can store information equivalent to &ldquo;a circle with a black outline and red fill, with centre at &hellip; and radius &hellip;&rdquo; and that will represent this image perfectly.</p>

<p id="bitmap-img">A <dfn>bitmap image</dfn> is represented as a grid of <dfn>pixels</dfn> each of which is given a particular colour. Here is the same image represented as both a vector and bitmap image:</p>

{{ figure('vector-bitmap2', 'A vector (left) and bitmap image (right)', extension='svg', referenced=False) }}

<p>Those probably look just about the same to you. If you're looking at this page on a very high resolution display like a modern smartphone or tablet, you might see that the vector representation on the left is slightly clearer, but otherwise they're likely identical.</p>

<p>The bitmap image looks good here because the pixels are very small: small enough to fool your eye into not seeing them as little squares, but as a smooth image.</p>

<p>If we zoom in on that image, you'll be able to see the difference between the two more clearly:</p>

{{ figure('vector-bitmap3', 'Enlargements of a vector (left) and bitmap image (right)', extension='svg', referenced=False) }}

<p>Now the difference is obvious. The vector image contains the information &ldquo;this is a circle&rdquo;, so when we zoom in it can be scaled smoothly: it's just a bigger circle. On the other hand, the bitmap image is just a collection of coloured square pixels, so fundamentally that's all we can work with when scaling the image.</p>

<p>In this case, the vector image will look nicer when printed or displayed on a high-resolution display. It will also be easier to edit it (for example, stretch it or change the fill colour).</p>

<p>For a more realistic example, consider this icon:</p>
{{ figure('phone-icon', 'An illustration', extension='svg', referenced=True) }}

<p>When saved as a vector image, the file is is about 2&nbsp;kilobytes. When saved as a bitmap image, the best I could do is 11&nbsp;kilobytes, so it would take about five times longer to download. Also remember that the vector image will scale more smoothly when being printed, or on high-resolution displays.</p>

<aside>To be fair, the difference between download times for 2 and 11&nbsp;kilobytes is tiny. The effect would be more severe for larger images.</aside>

<p>On the other hand, not all images make sense as a vector image. Since vector formats are best at the shapes they can represent (curves, lines, circles, etc.), images that aren't made up of those shapes might not be a good fit in a vector image.</p>

<p>For example, consider this photograph:</p>

{{ figure('phone-pic', 'A photograph', extension='jpg', referenced=True) }}

<p id="trace">As it is, the image is about 12&nbsp;kilobytes and looks nice. In an attempt to make a vector image, I have <dfn>traced</dfn> (or <dfn>vectorized</dfn>) the image in a vector editing program. This is an automatic attempt to turn the image into vector shapes:</p>

{{ figure('phone-pic-traced', 'A vectorized photograph', extension='svg', referenced=False) }}

<p>As you can see, it didn't go well. Even with all of the lost detail, the image grew to 54&nbsp;kilobytes.</p>

<aside>It is possible to embed a bitmap in a vector image and retain all of the detail, but that's not really a vector image: just a bitmap image wrapped up.</aside>

<p>It often makes sense to use a bitmap image because of the technology involved. For example, digital cameras inherently produce grids of pixels because of the way their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor">image sensors</a> work. Also, computer displays display grids of pixels so screen captures (like those in this course showing how web pages display on-screen) will inherently be bitmap images.</p>

<p>Hopefully the lesson is clear: choose vector images when the image is made of of &ldquo;shapes&rdquo; and bitmap images when it isn't.</p>

<p>There is really only one vector image format that is relevant to the web. <dfn>SVG</dfn> (or <dfn data-term="scalable vector graphics">Scalable Vector Graphics</dfn>) is a vector image format designed for use on the web. We will work more with SVG later in the course.</p>

<p>We will discuss bitmap file formats as we cover concepts that distinguish them&hellip;</p>

<section id="bitmaps">
<h2>Bitmap Images</h2>

<p>Let's return to the screenshot of the sample web page from {{ xref('html-attributes') }}:</p>
{{ figure('complete-page', 'Sample web page screenshot', extension='png', referenced=False) }}

<p>Since the image is a screenshot and computer displays inherently display bitmaps, this should be saved as a bitmap (not vector) image. Let's take a closer look at the first few characters in the first paragraph:</p>

{{ figure('compression1', 'Detail of screenshot', extension='png', referenced=False) }}

<p>As we expect, the image is made up of a grid of pixels. We can add a grid to make the individual pixels more clear:</p>

{{ figure('compression2', 'Detail with a pixel grid', extension='png', referenced=False) }}

<p>When the computer stores this bitmap data on disk (or transmits it over the Internet), is basically has to store the colour of each pixel. Essentially, that information is &ldquo;Row 1: white pixel, white pixel, white pixel, &hellip; Row 2: dark grey pixel, black pixel, black pixel, dark grey pixel, &hellip;&rdquo;. Of course, the way the computer represents that information isn't english descriptions like that, but the basic idea is the same.</p>

<p>The <dfn>BMP</dfn> (<dfn>Windows Bitmap</dfn>) format simply records the colour of each pixel with no compression (typically). If we save the original screenshot in that format the result is a 526&nbsp;kilobyte file. That is a lot of a relatively small image. The BMP format isn't used on the web because it produces such large files.</p>

<p>We can instead save an image as a <dfn>PNG</dfn> (<dfn>Portable Network Graphics</dfn>) which is common on the web. PNG uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression">data compression</a> to represent images in smaller files with no loss in quality. Saving the screenshot as a PNG, I got a 36&nbsp;kilobyte file: much smaller than without any compression, but we can do better if we actually understand a little more about images.</p>

</section>

<section id="depth">
<h2>Colour Depth</h2>

<p>One factor that has a larg impact on the size of a bitmap image file is the amount of information that much be stored <em>for each pixel</em>. This is determined by how many choices there are for the colour of each pixel.</p>

<p>In the figures above, we can see that there are relatively few colours actually used: white, black, and a few greys (and a few shades of blue for the link, which isn't in the enlargement).</p>

<p>The default for most image editing programs is images with a full range of colour for each pixel. This is called <dfn>24-bit colour</dfn> or <dfn>true colour</dfn>. The reason for the name &ldquo;24-bit colour&rdquo; is that each pixel can be any of 2<sup>24</sup></p>

</section>


<section id="compression">
<h2>Image Compression</h2>






<p>When I saved the screenshot as a JPEG image, the file size was 27&nbsp;kilobytes, larger than the PNG image. But worse, we can have a look at part of the result:</p>

{{ figure('compression3', 'Screenshot saved as JPEG', extension='png', referenced=False) }}

<p>That doensn't look too bad, but let's take a closer look at the same part of the image as above:</p>

{{ figure('compression4', 'JPEG detail', extension='png', referenced=False) }}

<p>Here we can see the real problem of JPEG compression when it's applied to non-photographs: since it's not designed for that type of image, it </p>
