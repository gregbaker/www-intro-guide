<p>Whenever HTML tags have been described here, the focus has been on what they <strong>mean</strong> or their <strong>purpose</strong> on the page, not on how they look:</p>
<blockquote>The <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;&hellip;&#8203;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag is used to enclose a paragraph on the page&hellip; The <code class="html">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag is used to create links&hellip; The horizontal rule element is used to indicate a break in the content.</blockquote>

<p id="semantic">None of these descriptions have been about what these elements look like in a web browser, because that's not what HTML describes. HTML is a <dfn>semantic markup language</dfn>. That is, its job is to describe the semantics of content: what that content means, what kind of content is is, or what its purpose or role is on the page.</p>

{{ lynda_course(path='/HTML-tutorials/HTML5-Structure-Syntax-Semantics/182177-2.html', title='HTML5: Structure, Syntax, and Semantics', description='This course provides <em>lots</em> of information on they way you should structure documents in HTML5.') }}

<p>When creating HTML pages, our goal should be to describe the content as accurately as possible with the tags we have.</p>

<p id="visual">The alternative is <dfn>visual markup</dfn> or <dfn>presentational markup</dfn> where the author specifies the appearance of content directly.</p>

<p>You may be familiar with visual and semantic formatting in word processors like Microsoft Word, or Google Docs word processing documents, which allow both. Note that Word and Docs are not <em>markup languages</em> (since there is no markup to write), but their formatting style can still be described as visual or semantic.</p>

{{ figure('google-docs-formatting', 'Google Docs tools for semantic formatting (left, under &ldquo;Normal text&rdquo;) and visual formatting (right, on the toolbar)', extension='png', referenced=False) }}

<p>In those screenshots, you can see visual formatting tools where you directly choose the font, style, colour, and so on. Both tools also have &ldquo;style&rdquo; tools where you can specify the type of content in a semantic way.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why Use Semantic Markup?</h2>

<p>The best reason for doing semantic markup is probably that it will let us use CSS effectively, as we will see in the unit on {{ xref('css') }}. CSS will let us make changes to the page like &ldquo;all paragraphs should look like &hellip;&rdquo;. If we used visual markup (to express something like &ldquo;this text is on a new line, left justified, in a 12pt font&rdquo; on each paragraph in our page) then we wouldn't be able to easily re-style everything: we would have to change each &ldquo;paragraph&rdquo; separately.</p>

<p>You may have had an experience like this using the tools described above for essays or other documents. If you format every section heading by selecting a font, then a size, then bold, they might all look fine. But if you then decide to change the style of your document, you have to change each one manually. This can be very time-consuming for a long document.</p>

<p>The word processor style tools let you change the way every &ldquo;Heading&nbsp;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;Subtitle&rdquo; looks at one time by changing the defaults for that type of content. This takes the same amount of time for one or a thousand pages.</p>

<p>Using semantic markup in HTML also helps your page be used in situations you might not have expected. For example, search engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, etc.) must read pages on the Web to figure out what they are about (to decide what search terms they should be returned for). These are entirely automated tools that must process pages algorithmically.</p>

<p>If we have done a good job with our markup, the search engines can extract lots of meaning (semantics) just from our markup. For example, just from examining the headings in the &ldquo;<a href="html-attributes.html#code-complete-page">complete page</a>&rdquo; example from the last topic, we get this outline for the document:</p>
<ol class="outline">
<li>HTML Basics
  <ol>
  <li>More to Learn</li>
  <li>Not In This Course</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>That is a decent summary of the document, and it can be easily discovered automatically from the markup. More can be discovered by examining the other tags, if they have been used correctly, in ways that match their meaning.</p>

<h2>How to Choose Tags</h2>
<p>We will see in the unit on CSS ways to control the appearance of pages. We will be able to use CSS to give appearances to each type of content. For now, we will have to accept the browsers' default styles for each element.</p>

<p>Since HTML is a <em>semantic</em> markup language, we should be keeping the meaning of our content in mind as we're creating the pages. When marking up new types of content, have a look at the <a href="{{htmlref_url}}">HTML reference</a> to see if there is a tag that makes sense for that content.</p>
</section>

<section id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Consider these sentences which we want to mark up appropriately in HTML:</p>

{{ figure('semantic', 'Example sentences to mark up', extension='svg', referenced=False) }}

<p>Each sentence has one word/phrase that is formatted differently. When choosing markup for content, we have to include markup for the <em>meaning</em> of the content. That means we can't just settle for a tag that <em>looks</em> right.</p>

<p>In the first sentence, the work &ldquo;you&rdquo; is highlighted as an important word in the sentence. The emphasis is placed on that word and that is important to the meaning here.</p>

<p>Looking in the <a href="{{htmlref_url}}">HTML reference</a>, the most appropriate element I see is <code class="html">&lt;em&gt;</code> which <a href="{{html_tag_ref_url('em')}}">is described as indicating</a> &ldquo;text that has stress emphasis&rdquo;, which sounds like what is happening here.</p>

<p>For the second sentence, the word &ldquo;never&rdquo; could also be wrapped in <code class="html">&lt;em&gt;</code>, but again looking at the reference we can find <a href="{{html_tag_ref_url('strong')}}" id="strong">the <code class="html dfn">&lt;strong&gt;</code> element</a> which &ldquo;gives text strong importance&rdquo;. It is basically like <code class="html">&lt;em&gt;</code> but with even more emphasis: that seems appropriate to a warning like this.</p>

<p>The text &ldquo;&lt;li&gt;&rdquo; in the third sentence is an example of HTML code. In the reference, we might look at <a href="{{html_tag_ref_url('kbd')}}" id="kbd"><code class="html dfn">&lt;kbd&gt;</code></a>, which &ldquo;represents user input&rdquo; and could be appropriate if we're asking the user to type something, but that doesn't sound like what is happening here. A better fit would be <a href="{{html_tag_ref_url('code')}}" id="code"><code class="html dfn">&lt;code&gt;</code></a> which &ldquo;represents a fragment of computer code&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After some looking at the available HTML tags and what they <em>mean</em>, we arrive at this markup for the first three sentences:</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/semantic1.html') }}

<p>That will look something like this in the web browser:</p>
{{ include_output('_sources/semantic1.html', cls='compact') }}

<p>That doesn't look exactly like the original sample, but that's not important here. The meaning is right and that's what we care about. We can worry about appearance later when we start working with {{ xref('css') }}.</p>

<p>We haven't suggested any markup for the last sentence, which has some text formatted differently because it's in a different language. By convention, non-English phrases are formatted in italics when printed.</p>

<p>If we look in the reference for a tag with a meaning like &ldquo;phrase in another language&rdquo;, we won't find one. What we need is a tag that we can use when nothing else fits&hellip;</p>

</section>

<section id="classid">
<h2>The <code class="html">class</code> and <code class="html">id</code> Attributes</h2>

<p>HTML has many usefu semantic tags that we can use to describe our content, but sometimes they can be limiting.</p>

<p>The <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is nice to enclose paragraphs, but there can be times you have more than one type of paragraph, for example normal paragraphs containing prose and a paragraph of copyright information at the bottom of the page (&ldquo;This page is copyright &copy; 2015&hellip;&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The <code class="html">class</code> and <code class="html">id</code> attributes can be used to give extra semantic information about elements. We can continue to use <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code> for most paragraphs, but <code class="html">&lt;p id="copyright"&gt;</code> for the one that is semantically different from the others.</p>

<p>The value of <code class="html">class</code> and <code class="html">id</code> can be any word, but should be meaningful (i.e. something about the meaning, not the appearance).</p>

<p>The different between the two is that a particular <code class="html">id</code> value can be used <em>only once</em> on a page. So we can have at most one element with <code class="html">id="copyright"</code>. That seems appropriate in this case sicne we only have one copyright notice per page.</p>

<aside>You might also use <code class="html">&lt;footer&gt;</code> for the copyright information, depending on the context, but that's not a good <code class="html">class</code>/<code class="html">id</code> example.</aside>

<p>The most likely reason to want to distinguish an element is to make it look different with CSS. We'll get to that later. For now we will use <code class="html">class</code> and <code class="html">id</code> just for semantic reasons.</p>

<p>As an example of this, in this guide there are many examples of computer code marked up as <code class="html">&lt;code&gt;</code> elements, but I wanted some to look different. HTML code looks like &ldquo;<code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code>&rdquo; but filenames look like &ldquo;<code class="file">filename.html</code>&rdquo;. In order to distinguish the two types of code, the markup used was <code class="html">&lt;code class="html"&gt;</code> and <code class="html">&lt;code class="file"&gt;</code>. It is then possible to grab these things separately in CSS and change their appearance. We need to use <code class="html">class</code> here, since there might be many HTML code examples on one page.</p>

</section>

<section id="generic">
<h2>Generic Tags</h2>

<p>In the above example, we came to a piece of content that we need to wrap in a tag because it is a different type of content, but find nothing matching its meaning in the HTML reference. This is inevitable: there is no way we could add HTML tags to match every kind of content that everyone ever uses.</p>

<p id="divspan">There are two <dfn>generic tags</dfn> to handle these cases: <a href="{{html_tag_ref_url('div')}}" id="divtag"><code class="html dfn">&lt;div&gt;</code></a> and <a href="{{html_tag_ref_url('span')}}" id="spantag"><code class="html dfn">&lt;span&gt;</code></a>.</p>

<p>The difference between the two is where they can be placed in the HTML.</p>

<p id="block">The <code class="html">&lt;div&gt;</code> element holds <dfn>block-level content</dfn> (or sometimes <dfn>flow content</dfn>). That is, it can go directly inside the <code class="html">&lt;body&gt;</code> and is displayed below the previous block. Other block-level elements we have seen include <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code class="html">&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code class="html">&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code class="html">&lt;ul&gt;</code>, and <code class="html">&lt;li&gt;</code>.</p>

<p id="inline">The <code class="html">&lt;span&gt;</code> elements holds <dfn>inline content</dfn> (or sometimes <dfn>phrasing content</dfn>). Inline content goes inside a block, so it part of a paragraph, heading, list item, or other block. Other inline elements include <code class="html">&lt;em&gt;</code>, <code class="html">&lt;a&gt;</code>, and <code class="html">&lt;abbr&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Because they don't have any meaning on their own, <code class="html">&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code class="html">&lt;span&gt;</code> should always be given a meaningful <code class="html">class</code> or <code class="html">id</code> value that indicates their purpose on the page.</p>

<p>We can now give markup for the last example above. We found no existing tag for a phrase in another language, so must choose a generic tag. The phrase is <em>part of</em> a paragraph, so we choose the inline tag <code class="html">&lt;span&gt;</code> and give it a meaningful class name. (We shouldn't use <code class="html">id</code> since there may be many other-language phrases on a single page.)</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/semantic2.html') }}

<p>When displayed on the page, the <code class="html">&lt;span&gt;</code> looks the same as other text. We will need to use CSS to change its appearance once we start working with it.</p>

{{ include_output('_sources/semantic2.html', cls='compact') }}

<p>We can actually improve this markup a little more by using the <code class="html">lang</code> attribute we saw earlier:</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/semantic3.html') }}

<p>This way, the text can be indexed more accurately by Google and your web browser may offer an automatic translation to English.</p>
