<h2>Libraries in Programming</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a full-featured programming language all by itself, but there are many tasks that programmers creating JavaScript need to do a lot which are not in the &ldquo;core&rdquo; language that is built into web browsers.</p>

<p>Every programming language is like this: the language itself lets programmers solve problems, but as the language is used, it becomes clear that some tasks must be done often (by at least some programmers). </p>

<section id="jquery">
<h2>jQuery</h2>

<p>JQuery is a very common JavaScript library (used on <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery">&gt;60%</a> of the most-visited web sites). It makes several common taks easier for the programmer: manipulating the HTML page, using events, animation.</p>

<p>We start by including the jQuery library, in the same way we include any other JavaScript code in the page: by using the <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code> element and indicating its URL.</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/script-jquery.html') }}

<p>Here is a complete page that uses the jQuery library:</p>
{{ quoted_code('files/jquery-first.html') }}

<p>And the JavaScript file <code class="file">jquery-event.js</code> that goes with it:</p>
{{ quoted_code('files/jquery-event.js') }}

<p>You can have a look at this <a href="{{rellink}}files/jquery-first.html">first page with jQuery</a> and see how it behaves.</p>

<p>There are lots of new concepts in this JavaScript file. It probably makes sense to take a look line-by-line.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code class="js">do_something = function() { &hellip; }</code></dt>
<dd>Just like before, this creates a function named <code class="js">do_something</code>. Also like before, this function can be called with <code class="js">do_something()</code> to run the code inside the <code class="js">{&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;}</code>.</dd>

<dt><code class="js">alert('Hello world!');</code></dt>
<dd>This one line is the code that runs when the <code class="js">do_something</code> function is called. It pops up an alert window with the phrase &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo;. That's maybe not too useful, but at least we can see when the function runs.

<p>The function <code class="js">alert()</code> is built into JavaScript, so we can call it without defining it.</p></dd>

<dt><code class="js">setup = function() { &hellip; }</code></dt>
<dd>We are defining this function to do the work of setting up the JavaScript behaviour on the page (thus the name &ldquo;setup&rdquo;). It will be called after the browser loads the page (because we'll trigger that below).</dd>

<dt><code class="js">jQuery('p').click(do_something);</code></dt>
<dd><p class="draft">Aw crap, what do I say here? Nothing? Everything won't fit.</p></dd>

<dt><code class="js">jQuery(document).ready(setup);</code></dt>
<dd>This line gets everything started. The <code class="js">jQuery(document).ready(&hellip;)</code> idiom gives a function that should be called once the browser finishes loading the page (i.e. it is &ldquo;ready&rdquo;). In our case, we want the <code class="js">setup</code> function called when the page is ready, so we indicate it here.</dd>
