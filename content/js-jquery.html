<h2>Libraries in Programming</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a full-featured programming language all by itself, but there are many tasks that programmers creating JavaScript need to do a lot which are not in the &ldquo;core&rdquo; language that is built into web browsers.</p>

<p>Every programming language is like this: the language itself lets programmers solve problems, but as the language is used, it becomes clear that some tasks must be done often (at least by programmers creating certain kinds of programs: others might have different common problems).</p>

<p id="code-library">It would be inefficient for every programmer, or even each project/company to solve these problems separately. So, developers often publish their solutions to frequently-encountered problems in <dfn>code libraries</dfn> (or just <dfn>libraries</dfn>). These libraries can be used by other programmers so they don't have to re-solve the same problems.</p>

<p>The ways JavaScript is used have evolved considerably since it was first introduced. Because of this, there are some libraries that are used <em>very</em> frequently to take care of things that almost every JavaScript program needs to handle. We will be starting with one that contains some basics that we'll need (and adding more later in the course).</p>

<section id="jquery">
<h2>jQuery</h2>

<p><dfn id="jquery-dfn" data-term="jQuery">JQuery</dfn> is a very common JavaScript library (used on <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery">more than half</a> of the most-visited web sites). It makes several common tasks easier for the programmer: manipulating the HTML page, using events, animation.</p>

<p>We start by including the jQuery library, in the same way we include any other JavaScript code in the page: by using the <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code> element and indicating its URL.</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/script-jquery.html') }}

<p>Including the jQuery library like this defines a function called <dfn id="jquery-func" data-term="jQuery function"><code class="js">jQuery</code></dfn> that will do lots of useful stuff, if we know how to use it.</p>

<p>Here is a complete page that uses the jQuery library:</p>
{{ quoted_code('files/jquery-first.html') }}

<p>And the JavaScript file <code class="file">jquery-event.js</code> that goes with it:</p>
{{ quoted_code('files/jquery-event.js') }}

<p>You can have a look at this <a href="{{rellink}}files/jquery-first.html">first page with jQuery</a> and see how it behaves.</p>

<p>There are lots of new concepts in this JavaScript file. It probably makes sense to take a look line-by-line.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code class="js">say_hello = function() { &hellip; }</code></dt>
<dd><p>Just like before, this creates a function named <code class="js">say_hello</code>. Also like before, this function can be called with <code class="js">say_hello()</code> to run the code inside the <code class="js">{&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;}</code>.</p></dd>

<dt><code class="js">alert('Hello world!');</code></dt>
<dd><p>This one line is the code that runs when the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function is called. As before, it pops up an alert window with the phrase &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo;.</p></dd>

<dt><code class="js">setup = function() { &hellip; }</code></dt>
<dd><p>We are defining this function to do the work of setting up the JavaScript behaviour on the page (thus the name &ldquo;setup&rdquo;). It will be called after the browser loads the page (because we'll trigger that in the next lines of code).</p></dd>

<dt><code class="js">jQuery('p').click(say_hello);</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code class="js">jQuery</code> function is used to select some part(s) of the page. The function call <code class="js">jQuery('p')</code> selects <em>every <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code> element on the page</em>.</p>
<p>Following with <code class="js">.click(&hellip;)</code> sets the behaviour we want when those elements are clicked: in this case, we give it the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function. (We don't want to call the function right now, so we don't say <code class="js">say_hello()</code>. We just want to give jQuery the function <strong>it</strong> should call later, so we just give it the variable that holds it.)</p>
</dd>

<dt><code class="js">jQuery(document).ready(setup);</code></dt>
<dd><p>This line gets everything started. The <code class="js">jQuery(document).ready(&hellip;)</code> idiom gives a function that should be called once the browser finishes loading the page (i.e. it is &ldquo;ready&rdquo;). In our case, we want the <code class="js">setup</code> function called when the page is ready, so we indicate it here.</p>
<p>This <code class="js">jQuery</code> is similar to the previous: it selects something (in this case the <code class="js">document</code> special value, referring to the entire page), and connects some event (the document being ready, as opposed to being clicked as above) to a function.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<aside>The <code class="js">jQuery</code> function can also be called <dfn id="dollar"><code class="js">$</code></dfn>, so <code class="js">jQuery('p')</code> and <code class="js">$('p')</code> are synonymous. We'll use <code class="js">jQuery</code> here, since it looks more like other function names.</aside>

<p class="draft">I should put this somewhere... where?</p>
{{ quoted_code('_sources/jquery1.js') }}

<p>Notice that we didn't use the <code class="html">onclick</code> attribute in HTML here, but connected the logic to the HTML with jQuery. This puts all of the logic in the JavaScript file where it belongs, and leaves only content in the HTML. It also prevents repetition, since we can modify all of the pharagras at once, instead of having to say something for each <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code> on the page.
We will continue to do things this way, and you should as well.</p>

<p>Have another look at this <a href="{{rellink}}files/jquery-first.html">first page with jQuery</a>, and the <a href="{{rellink}}files/jquery-event.js">JavaScript code it uses</a>. Make sure you see how the behaviour unfolds: when the page is loaded, the <code class="js">setup</code> function is called to hook up the other events; it connects the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function to the click event on all of the paragraphs; when you click a paragraph <code class="js">say_hello</code> is called and does something you can actually see.</p>

</section>

<section id="selectors">
<h2>jQuery Selectors</h2>

<p>In the above example, we saw this code fragment and said that it affected every <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code> on the page.</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/selector1.js') }}

<p id="select">The string <code class="js">'p'</code> given to the <code class="js">jQuery</code> function is a <dfn>selector</dfn> (or <dfn>jQuery selector</dfn> to be more specific). In this case, it selects all paragraphs exactly like the CSS selector <code class="css">p</code> does. (Remember {{ xref('css-selectors') }}?)</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/selector2.css') }}

<p> This is not an accident: jQuery selectors were designed to work like CSS selectors because most developers already know how to use CSS selectors and find them easy to work with.</p>

<p>For example, you can select the element from a page with <code class="html">id="special"</code> like this:</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/selector3.js') }}

<p>That is probably the most useful jQuery selector, since you often want to modify a specific element, and we know that <code class="html">id</code> values must be unique (otherwise the page won't validate). Thus, selecting by <code class="html">id</code> gives us an easy way to grab a particular element.</p>

<p>There are some differences between CSS selectors and jQuery selectors, but for now you can safely assume they are the same. (The differences are mostly that jQuery extends things so you can specify things in jQuery that won't work in CSS.)</p>

</section>

<section id="object">
<h2>The jQuery Object</h2>

<p id="obj">We can now use the <code class="js">jQuery(&hellip;)</code> function to select various parts of the page. After calling the function, what it gives back is a <dfn>jQuery object</dfn>. As mentioned in {{ xref('js-varfunc', fragment='objects') }}, <dfn>objects</dfn> in JavaScript can contain other stuff: numbers, strings, functions, etc.</p>

<p>This is the first object we have actually worked with: <code class="js">jQuery('p')</code> is an object with a bunch of stuff in it.</p>

<p>To get at the stuff inside an object, we use the dot (<code class="js">.</code>), so <code class="js">jQuery('p').click</code> refers to something named <code class="js">click</code> in that object. We know that <code class="js">click</code> is in there because it's in the jQuery documentation, which also says that it's a function we can call.</p>

<p>Here is a closer look at the parts of the jQuery statement above, and why it does what it does:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code class="js">jQuery</code></dt>
<dd>The main jQuery function that we use to access the library's functionality.</dd>
<dt><code class="js">jQuery('p')</code></dt>
<dd>A jQuery object representing all paragraphs on the page.</dd>
<dt><code class="js">jQuery('p').click</code></dt>
<dd>A function that operates on all everything in the jQuery object (in this case, all paragraphs).</dd>
<dt><code class="js">jQuery('p').click(say_hello)</code></dt>
<dd>Calling that function gives us a statement that actually does something: it connects the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function to the click event of everything in that jQuery object.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There are many other things in each jQuery object, and we will work with some as the course goes on.</p>
</section>


<section id="modify">
<h2>Modifying the Page</h2>

<p>After we select some part(s) of the page with the <code class="js">jQuery</code> function, there are lots of things we can do with  the result. So far, we have only seen one thing: connect a function to the &ldquo;click&rdquo; event.</p>

<p>There is another function in jQuery objects called <code class="js">html</code> that can be used to modify the contents of the page.</p>

</section>


<p class="draft">Maybe another example and introduce .html() here?</p>
