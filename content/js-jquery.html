<h2>Libraries in Programming</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a full-featured programming language all by itself, but there are many tasks that programmers creating JavaScript need to do a lot which are not in the &ldquo;core&rdquo; language that is built into web browsers.</p>

<p>Every programming language is like this: the language itself lets programmers solve problems, but as the language is used, it becomes clear that some tasks must be done often (by at least some programmers). </p>

<h2>jQuery</h2>

<p>JQuery is a very common JavaScript library (used on <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery">&gt;60%</a> of the most-visited web sites). It makes several common taks easier for the programmer: manipulating the HTML page, using events, animation.</p>

<p>We start by including the jQuery library, in the same way we include any other JavaScript code in the page: by using the <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code> element and indicating its URL.</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/script-jquery.html') }}

<p>Here is a complete page:</p>
{{ quoted_code('files/jquery-first.html') }}
