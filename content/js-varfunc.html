<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

<p class="draft">TODO: a variable has a name and holds a value. = assigns one.</p>

<p>In the previous example, we saw a function beign defined like this:</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/varassign1.js') }}

<p>This is actually much more general than just defining a function. What's actually happening in code this this is that <em>some</em> value is being stored in a variable.</p>

<p id="var">A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a way to store a value in our program. In this example, the variable is named <code class="js">say_hello</code>. The <code class="js">=</code> is used to <dfn>assign</dfn> to the variable: it takes the value on the right and stores it in the variable named on the left.</p>

<p id="varassign">This line of code is a <dfn>variable assignment statement</dfn>. When a variable assignment statement runs, the value is stored in the computer's memory and the variable name can be used to refer back to that value later.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, any type of value can be stored in any variable, and there are many types the language supports&hellip;</p>

<section id="types">
<h2>Types</h2>

<p id="type">Like other programming languages, JavaScript can store and manipulate different <dfn>types</dfn> of values.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>

<p>Let's look again at the <code class="file">first-event.js</code> file:</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/first-event.js', ident='code-first-event2') }}

<p id="func">This code creates a variable named <code class="js">say_hello</code>. This variable holds a <dfn>function</dfn>. Functions are used to is used to contain some logic: it could be a particular calculation, code you want to execute as the result of an event, or any other sensible collection of logic.</p>

<p>Our function definitions will look like this (with a few more parts to be added later):</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/function_template.js') }}

<p>This creates a function called <code class="js">function_name</code>. When we <dfn id="call">call</dfn> that function (ask that it be executed), the logic in the <code class="js">{&hellip;}</code> will run line-by-line. [There is other syntax to define functions in JavaScript as well. We're going to ignore that.]</p>

<p>A function is called by using its name (or if you'd rather think of it this way: the name of the variable that is holding it), and parenthesis after it, like &ldquo;<code class="js">say_hello()</code>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In the HTML file above, we used a function call like this as the value for the <code class="html">onclick</code> property of the paragraph. When you click the paragraph, your web browser runs this JavaScript code, thus calling the function and running the logic in it.</p>

<p>Inside the function <code class="js">say_hello</code>, we call another function <code class="js">alert</code>. This function requires an <dfn id="arg">argument</dfn> which gives it more information about what it is supposed to do. The argument is put in the parenthesis and is <code class="js">'Hello world!'</code> in our example.</p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="{{rellink}}files/first-js.html">the example page with JavaScript</a> above. Click the paragraph: make sure you see what happens.</p>
