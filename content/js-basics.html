<h2>Linking Scripts</h2>
<p class="draft">The script tag and basic ideas of JS (hooking a function up to an onclick event)</p>

<p>The <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code> element is used to connect JavaScript to HTML pages. When the browser encounters <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code>, it will load and run the code (similar to the way it loads stylesheets for <code class="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> or images for <code class="html">&lt;img&gt;</code></p>

<p>We will usually write JavaScript code in separate files named <code class="file">something.js</code>. We can link this to a web page like this:</p>

{{ quoted_code('_sources/script-first.html') }}

<p>The <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag has no contents (the end tag comes immediately after the start tag). This element causes the browser to load the code from the relative URL <code class="url">mycode.js</code> and execute it.</p>

</section>

<section id="first-js">
<h2>First JavaScript Code</h2>

<p>Now that we can tell the browser about a JavaScript file, we should actually write some code. As a first step, here is a line of code that can go in our <code class="file">first-code.js</code> file:</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/first-code.js') }}

<p>That one line will run when the browser processes the <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code> element. You can have a look at <a href="{{rellink}}files/first-js.html">that HTML page</a> and see what happens.</p>
<p>As the page loads, the browser runs that one line of JavaScript code, which causes an alert message to appear (before the rest of the page loads, since the <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code> element comes before the rest ofthe page). When you click OK, the browser will continue.</p>

<p id="fn">In this code, <code class="js">alert</code> is a JavaScript <dfn>function</dfn>. A function represents some logic that we can run by <dfn title="calling (a function)">calling</dfn> the function. The <code class="js">alert</code> function is built into JavaScript; we will define functions of our own very soon.</p>

<p>When we mention a function by name with parenthesis after it, we are indicating that we want to call the function. In the parenthesis, we put whatever <dfn>arguments</dfn> the function needs to run. In the case of <code class="js">alert</code>, we give it the string (in quotes) that shold be displayed in the alert message.</p>

<p>Try saving these files: <a href="{{rellink}}files/first-js.html">the HTML page</a> and <a href="{{rellink}}files/first-code.js">the JavaScript</a>. Add another call to the <code class="js">alert</code> function in the <code class="file">.js</code> file and see how the behaviour changes.</p>
</section>

<section id="first-event">
<h2>Controlling Execution: Functions and Events</h2>

<p>We don't really want all of our code to run at the moment the page loads. We want to be able to attach behaviour to things the user does.</p>

<p>In order to do this, we will wrap our code up in a function. That way, we can call the function when we want it to run: like we did with <code class="js">alert</code> before, but with a function we have created.</p>

<p>We can put that line of code (that creates the alert message) in a function like this:</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/first-event.js') }}

<p>This defines a function named <code class="js">say_hello</code> so we can use it later. Nothing visible to the user happens when the browser loads the code: it just defines the <code class="js">say_hello</code> so we can use it later.</p>

<p>And here is an HTML file that loads and uses this JavaScript code:</p>

{{ quoted_code('files/event.html') }}

<p>You can have a look at <a href="{{rellink}}files/event.html">that HTML page</a> and see how it works: try clicking on the paragraph.</p>

<p>Notice the <code class="html">onclick</code> attribute given to the paragraph. The value there gives JavaScript code that will execute when the user clicks the paragraph. In this case, clicking the paragraph will call the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function (with no arguments). In turn, <code class="js">say_hello</code> will call <code class="js">alert</code> and do something we can actually see.</p>
</section>

<section id="events">
<h2>Events</h2>

<p>In the HTML above, you will see the new property <code class="html">onclick</code>. This property is used to connect some JavaScript code to an event on the page.</p>

<p id="event">An <dfn>event</dfn> in HTML is triggered by certain things that the user does, or that happen in the browser. For example, the &ldquo;click&rdquo; event occurs when the user clicks on the element. In the example above, you can click on the paragraph and it triggers execution of some JavaScript logic.</p>

<p>There are several other events on elements and we will use some of then as the course goes on. For example, there are events &ldquo;mouseover&rdquo; (when the mouse cursor moves over an element, on a desktop computer), &ldquo;load&rdquo; (when the page has finished loading), &ldquo;touchstart&rdquo; (the user starts touching an element, on a mobile device), and &ldquo;change&rdquo; (the user changes the entry in a form element). We will introduce more event types as they are needed.</p>

<p>The value for the event property (<code class="html">say_hello()</code> in the example) is a piece of JavaScript code. It will usually be short and used to call longer pieces of logic written elsewhere. In this example, it calls the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function defined in the JavaScript file.</p>
